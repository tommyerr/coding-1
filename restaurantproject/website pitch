Project:Burger Prince 

tommyer.

The concept of burger prince is mainly to appeal to the countries and places that dont have any burger king the same concept of how australia has a burger king sort of place called hungry jacks instead of burger king. So our locations will be places without a burger king so places like north korea and maybe if this chain is successful we will decide to spread out the chain to different areas if proven popular so we can spread our chain to other places and not limited to certain places. Just how like different burger kings have menu items speciific to there country or place or how they only have hungry jacks in australia and their food items cant be accessed outside australia. Our website will have all menu items and the prices so you can get a delivery or order ahead of time. Because you have the option to order ahead of time our website will have a locations page so you can get directions to our address where the building is located. On the website there will be a work for us page if anyone is intrested into helping spread and popularize our food chain. On our websites we will also have pictures of our buildings so they are recognizable also along with pictures of our food and menu items. On our website there will also show limited time items like seasonal items and new items that may leave soon. back to talking about our locations the main one spoken about was North Korea we will also be located in nepal iceland bolivia and ghana. The reason we decided to name our restaurant burger prince because we decided to bring items just like burger kings items with alot of differences because it will be a entirely different place so it will have different menu items exclusive to our store to reel people into trying our new restaurant with all new items to try.
